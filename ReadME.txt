[ pyBlind # ReadME ]

The tool you are using is a great tool for detecting blind-sql Injection vulnerabilities.
In general, using this tool is very simple and provides you with good facilities.

But if you are a programmer :

You can make changes to these scripts by examining the script code and finding the variables in
which the target URL is stored.
For example:
